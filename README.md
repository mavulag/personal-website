## IS 181 ASSIGNMENT

## DEADLINE: 28th June 2021

Create a personal website with the following menu items: home, about me, register, courses, CV,
and contacts.
* The home menu item should point to a landing page of your website. It should welcome
visitors to your website and give them general information about you and your website.

* The about me menu item should:

summarise your education background;

describe the university programme you are currently enrolled in, why you
enrolled in it, your favourite course in the programme you are enrolled in, and your
discussion group;

describe the means of sponsoring your degree—whether you are self-sponsored,
on a scholarship, or sponsored by the Higher Education Students’ Loans Board
(HESLB); and

outline your career goals.

* The register menu item should allow a user of your website to create an account that
they can use to access specific parts of the website. 

It should have a registration form that
captures the following information: 

first name, middle name, surname, username,
password, CV (uploaded as a file), contacts (email address, mobile number, and social media
accounts (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram)). Email addresses should be checked for
correctness upon entry, and the password should be at least 10 characters long and should
contain both alphanumeric characters and special characters.

* The courses menu item should get you to a page where you can register and display
information about the various courses you have attended so far at the university. 

Among other things, you should have a form to capture the following information and store it into
the database: course name, course code, brief course description, offering department,
semester in which it is/was offered, academic year, name of course instructor, and results
(grade). 

The application should strive to minimize direct typing of user inputs; it should,
instead, try as much as possible to allow a user to select inputs from a range of possible
values for a particular form field. Appropriate validations of form field values should be
made to ensure, among other things, that both course name and instructor's name cannot
exceed 30 characters, course description cannot exceed 50 characters, and inappropriate
grades are flagged. Importantly, the website should also be able to retrieve and display on a
web page, in tabular form, all course information stored in the database. 

Access to the contents of the courses menu item should only be allowed for registered users upon
successful login to the website.

* The CV menu item should enable the display of your detailed CV.

* The contacts menu should enable the display of your contacts.
